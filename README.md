## Description
A nodejs app for storing, tracking, and updating employee information. The app uses inquirer prompts in the terminal, and stores the information input by the user in an sql database. The database has tables for departments, roles, and employees, with each role belonging to a department, and each employee having a role. The user can create new entries and update existing ones. Any changes to the database are displayed in the terminal with console.table().
